# About the game
Magelight is a spell-slinging hidden role card game for 4-6 players. It can run anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the size of the group and the amount of discussion you engage in between turns. Add house rules to keep things moving or make an evening out of this ice-blasting, nail-biting game of deduction, betrayal and magic.

## The Story

Your table plays as a reclusive guild of mages living atop a mountain that overlooks two warring kingdoms. Both of these kingdoms are, in their own way, oppressive and tyrannical.

As their war reaches a fever pitch, the guild becomes concerned that their magic may fall into the hands of whichever faction wins out. A decision is made that- rather than let their power be coopted and used for evil- the guild will assemble to erase every record of their existence from the mountain. They will burn every spell, and cast every hexed artifact into the Void where no commander will find it, and then they will disband.

There is a problem, however. One of the kingdom's spies has discovered this plan. They have sent a small band of Infiltrators to steal the guild's secrets and stop the ritual.

The true Guildmages among you must leverage your spells, allies and your knowledge of arcane artifacts to discover who is friend and who is foe and complete this vital ritual.

## Setup

To play, you will need:
- The current set of play cards (100 total)
- The appropriate number of Role cards (see below)
- A round counter
- A play mat and 3 tokens (coins work) for each player

Each player takes a play mat and sets down 1 token denoting their Power (starts at 3), one denoting their Actions (starts at 0) and one denoting their Mana (starts at 0).

Place the deck of cards in the middle of the table and identify a location for your two other card piles- Discard and Burn- somewhere on the table.

Place the round counter somewhere all players can see it and set a token on the "1" spot.

Shuffle and randomly distribute the Role cards, one to each player. Each player reads their card and may talk about what's on it, but they may not show it to anyone else.

Any one player must then do the following:
- Ask every player to close their eyes
- After a brief pause, ask the Infiltrators to open their eyes to see who their teammates are
- After a few moments, ask the Infiltrators to close their eyes
- After a few moments, ask everyone to open their eyes again

If there is a mistake during this process (someone mistakenly opens, or the Infiltrators say they didn't have time to see one another), redistribute the cards and repeat.

Now, the game is setup. Whoever is youngest at the table goes first, and you will continue in a clockwise direction.

## The Objective

The objective of the game depends on the team you are a part of.

**For the Guildmages**, who make up the majority of the players but do not initially know who is friend or foe, the object is to either:

- Force all Infiltrators to reveal their role to the table through spells and powerful allies **and** reduce all of those players' Power to 0, or
- Burn the entire deck, so that someone tries to draw a card when there are no cards in the deck

There is a subtle caveat with each of the Guildmage win conditions. For the first, the idea of revealing a player's role _to the table_ is distinct from cards that reveal the role to a specific player. Look for cards that say 'target player must reveal their role,' rather than 'target player shows their role to the player on their right,' for instance.

With the second win condition- milling the deck- its worth mentioning that when a card needs to be drawn from the deck but the deck is empty the _discard pile_ gets shuffled back into the deck. So the Guildmages need to create a situation where there are no cards in either the deck or the discard pile- by burning everything.

**For the Infiltrators** there are also two ways to win. They must either:
- Play a card called **"Dark Day"** which is very expensive, or:
- Reduce **all** Guildmage players' Power to 0.

Since the Infiltrators already know who their enemies are, there is no need to reveal Guildmage roles for either win condition.

## Resources

Your playmat tracks three resources. Their purpose will become more clear in the next section, but very briefly:

- **Mana** is used to cast spells and summon allies. You gain free mana each turn- one on your first turn, and the amount increases by 1 each time you go around the table. This free mana value is indicated by the round counter. Mana is also gained by _burning spells_ and all mana is lost when your turn ends.
- **Actions** represent the number of things you can do on your turn. Actions include playing spells and activating some card effects.
- **Power** represents your overall influence on the game. At the beginning of each turn, as your mana is being set to the value of the round counter, your Actions are set to the current value of your Power.

_**Question:** Are you out of the game if your Power hits 0?_ No. There are things you can do with 0 Power, and there are many ways you can regain Power at any point in the game.

## Card Types

Cards come in three varieties which effect how they behave:
- **Spells** are played during the course of your turn. Their effects are resolved and the card is placed into the discard pile
- **Allies** are played and remain on your board- the space in front of you- until removed by some other card. Their effects resolve at the start of every turn after they're played. Unless a phrase like 'you may,' is used, these effects resolve automatically.
- **Artifacts** are not played. When you draw one, you must reveal the card and immediately resolve its effects. The card then remains in your hand.

## Your Turn

Time to put it all together. On your turn you will do the following. First, a few automatic actions:
- Resolve all ally effects, starting with the most recently-played ally
- Draw 3 cards (or 6 if you're going first _and_ this is the first round)
- Pick up the 3 cards left by the last player (with the above exception)
- Pick up any cards you've previously placed in Storage
- The cards you're now holding make up your Hand
- Check your hand for Artifacts, reveal and resolve any you find. In the case of multiple artifacts, you may choose the order in which they resolve.
- Set your Actions to match your current Power and set your Mana to match the current value of the Round Counter

Now you may use your actions to do any of the following in any order. Each time you take an action, reduce your Actions counter by 1.
- **Burn a card** to add its _burn value_ to your mana counter. Place it in the burn pile.
- **Play an ally or a spell** so long as you have enough mana to pay its _mana cost_. Reduce your mana counter appropriately. If its a spell, resolve it and place it into the discard pile. If its an ally, simply place it in front of you.
- **Store a card** face-down in front of you (this is your Storage). There is no limit to how many cards you can keep in storage, but since the entire contents of your storage is added to your hand at the top of every turn, you will need to use an action to store a given card *every turn* you wish to store it through.

_**Question:** Do Artifacts drawn from storage resolve again and again?_ Yes. It's dope.

The one restriction on this step is that you _must_ keep enough cards in your hand to pass 3 cards (the stack) to the next player.

Once you've taken your actions for the turn, pick 3 cards to place in the Stack, which will be added to the next player's hand, and place any remaining cards in the discard pile. Set your mana to 0. If you were the last player to take their turn, increment the Round Counter by 1.

It is now the next player's turn.

## Keyword Glossary

To save from repeatedly writing some common phrases, the following keywords have been implemented:

- **SUPPORT** is an ally keyword that means that, as long as that ally is in play, you get one extra action per turn.
- **NOMAD** is an ally keyword that means that the ally is played onto someone else's board instead of yours
- **CHANNEL** is typically a spell keyword that means that, as an additional cost to play the spell or trigger a specific effect, you must place one card (or more if a number follows the keyword) into the burn pile while not gaining any mana from it. This does not count as a burn and does not require an additional action
- **SECRET** is an artifact keyword meaning that you do not need to reveal the card to the table. You still need to do what it says on the card, and this keyword is typically paired with **REVEAL**, which indicates a bonus effect that triggers if you choose to reveal the card like a normal artifact
